# Array-to-Matrix
I was doing some DSA questions on Leetcode and wanted to visualize a 2D array as a matrix because I had a bug to fix. I didn't find any online tool for that, so I decided to make this tool using OpenScript.Js (A JS frontend Library I developed that works purely in the browser, no module, no bundles).   

This Array to Matrix library can visualize Any nxn-dimensional array. Try it out here: https://levizwannah.github.io/array-to-matrix/

# Input
You should enter a valid JSON array string as input. You can visualize an nxn dimensional array.  
example
```json
["a", "b", "c", "c"]

[
    ["a", "b", "c", "c"],
    ["e", "f", "g", "h"],
    ["i", "j", "k", "l"],
    ["m", "n", "o", "p"]
]

[
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]
]

```
